# About Me

Hey there, I’m **M. Volkan** 👋  
My tech journey started unusually early — I was one of those lucky kids who had a computer at home from day one.  
I grew up on **Windows 95, DOS**, and the magical sound of dial-up internet.  
In **2007**, I met Linux… and let’s just say things were never the same after that.

## 🐧 Linux & Open Source: A Long-Term Relationship

Linux isn’t just an operating system for me —  
it’s the place where my brain feels at home.

- First touched Linux in 2007  
- Played with everything from Debian/Ubuntu to RHEL, CentOS, SUSE  
- Windows? It’s fine… but the penguin is my real love 😄  
- Open source is my comfort zone: transparent, logical, and endlessly customizable

## 🚀 What I Do

In recent years, I’ve been deep into **DevOps, Cloud, and modern infrastructure engineering**.

My day-to-day includes:

- Designing and managing Kubernetes clusters  
- Building rock-solid CI/CD pipelines  
- Automating systems with Ansible  
- Tuning performance and hardening servers  
- Improving observability  
- Troubleshooting bizarre production issues without panicking  
- Managing backups, DR strategies, HA clusters, and complex networking  
- Constant experimentation, benchmarking, and optimization  

Basically:  
**If it runs in production, I make sure it runs well.**

## 🔧 What I Play With (aka My Hobbies)

Outside the production world, I’m usually surrounded by even more tech:

- **Arduino projects**  
- **Home automation** experiments  
- **Raspberry Pi** everything  
- **Electronics & wiring** (sometimes on purpose)  
- **Automotive repairs** — from diagnostics to “let’s see what happens if I fix this myself”  
- And yes…  
  **I love hacking any device that can take a custom firmware.**  
  Routers, TVs, IoT toys, random gadgets — if it has firmware, I’m interested 😄

These are not just hobbies; they keep me curious, sharp, and constantly learning.

## 🔥 What Defines My Work Style

- I genuinely *enjoy* solving problems  
- I treat performance tuning like a hobby  
- “It works” is never enough — it must work *properly*  
- Breaking things to understand them doesn’t scare me  
- Automation is my default instinct  
- Details matter — and so does reliability  

---

## 🎯 My Mission

To share what I learn, help others navigate the Linux & DevOps world, and give back to the open-source community.

This blog is where I document real-world solutions, architectures, failures, fixes, and the occasional  
**“I can't believe this actually worked”** moment.

## ☕ Final Note

If you love Linux, open source, automation, hardware tinkering, or the constant pursuit of  
“a better way to do this” — we’ll get along just fine.
